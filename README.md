# Threat_analysis
This Python script performs a basic correlated threat analysis using a PCAP file and an IDS alerts file. It identifies a likely infected host, extracts its MAC address, hostname, and Windows user account (if available), and lists potential malicious URLs and file hashes. Uses pyshark for PCAP processing and re for alert parsing.
